### Interpreting Contextual Research

Returning to the Holtzblatt text we now look at how to effectively share data from contextual research and take next steps towards acting on it.

### Gulfs of Evaluation and Execution

The final lesson from Don Norman's course at Udacity discusses how users can get stuck in one of two gulfs related to how we designed things for them poorly.

### Introduction to Paper Prototyping

Here is a little more detail with you about creating paper prototypes. Keep in mind the following goals:

* Get ideas out on paper quickly. We're not looking for highly-polished concepts. We're not interested in color (unless its necessary for a signifier). We ARE looking to communicate well, so an appropriate amount of detail to convey the information on the page is necessary.
* Get whole sets of screens and variations of the screens in front of users early in the process for feedback. We want users to be able to step through a complete task, even if its a simple one, based on a simple prompt from you. Such as, "Here is the home page for my redesign of Widgets, Inc. website. If you wanted to find out what kinds of products they offered, what would you do?" This is generally aimed at evaluating "Can the user find products easily in our redesign?" but does not actually tell them what to do; the interface should give them what they need.

So as the process listed online in the instructions indicates, you should start by just ideating with thumbnail sketches. These should allow you to play with the components your pages will need without worrying at all about details. Next you should recreate your strongest directions at close-to-life-size and with enough detail for users to see what they need for each "screen", "page", or otherwise step in the process. You DO NOT need to sketch every possible screen of the site or application; only the key steps to get users to their goal for your future test.

So you create these with paper and pencil. As needed, you can cut out smaller pieces to lay over for modal windows, tabbed panels, etc. But overall do just keep it simple. Show each necessary step in the process.<

Here is a [sample video](https://youtu.be/pL81u49icRI).

For Project Deliverable 1C you should first finish your wireframes with paper and pen or pencil (this ought to be easy to accomplish inside of a few hours; think rapid prototyping). Then make a basic video of you walking through the tasks you expect to use for testing in 1D (actual deliverable with test results is due next week). This does not need to be edited; something recorded with a smart phone should be fine; just ensure that the screens you've designed can be seen in the video and that your walkthrough reflects a complete task the user will complete in your tests next week. Most smart phones allow you to share directly to YouTube or otherwise export the video into a format you can upload to YouTube.
