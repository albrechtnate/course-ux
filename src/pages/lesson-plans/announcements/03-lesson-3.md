Dear Students,

Great work this week folks. ***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

We're continuing with Holtzblatt and wrapping up Norman this week. We're also getting into the idea of rapid prototyping through a sketching exercise in the forum and then creating paper prototypes for your Project 1 in P1C.

Please note the following as we move into Lesson 3 this week:

* Discussion is a little different this week with two threads for topical discussion and a third for posting a larger sketching exercise. Be sure to read the instructions for this ASAP and let me know if you have any questions. You'll want to get started on this sooner than later as opposed to leaving it to the last minute. Note that we're looking for *rapid sketches not artistic renderings*.
* P1C challenges you to create paper prototypes as an initial step towards getting your redesign concepts going and in P1D we'll actually take them to users for some early testing. Bear in mind that while you might have some aesthetic goals you should have specific user tasks in mind to improve as well. Your prototype should aim at those tasks primarily. *Aesthetics will come later.* You'll also create a quick video of you walking through the prototype. For this, talk out loud as if you are a user thinking out loud about the process you're walking through.
* P1D (due next lesson) requires you to get out and do user testing with your paper prototypes. Be sure to plan ahead for this for next week and note that 5 users are a required minimum. More will show exceptional effort and likely lead to better outcomes.

Things are getting more complex here so please don't hesitate to reach out and ask questions.

Have a great week,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
