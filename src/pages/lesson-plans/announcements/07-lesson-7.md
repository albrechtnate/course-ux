Dear Students,

***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

This week we continue our readings from Garrett, focusing on the Structure plane. We also conduct user research for Project 2, for which you should have submitted proposals before the break. I've given feedback on these, so make sure to get going on your research asap this week and follow the requirements outlined in the deliverable, especially noting the appendix in which I expect to see your advanced plans for research along with data you collect. I believe that this deserves a little more time than we have in just this week, so I have decided to extend the due date for this to next Tuesday by 5pm. Please do not put it off, but pace yourself to do this well! The task flow diagram will be a logical followup and will keep its current due date for next Friday.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
