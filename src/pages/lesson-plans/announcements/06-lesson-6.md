Dear Students,

***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

Now for Lesson 6 we will dive into the details for the Scope and Strategy planes from the Garret text. Your project deliverable this week is to build out your full mockups and wire them up on InVision as an interactive prototype. Note that you DO NOT have to build or link every page, but you must at least simulate the task or tasks you tested and targeted to improve in the project goals. As a reminder, you must use Sketch to complete this deliverable as well as implement the Craft plugin to upload to InVision. Please plan to test this early in the week so you're not caught last minute later if something doesn't work as expected.

Thinking ahead, *next week* is a big week for which you should be preparing:

- Your final deliverable for Project 1 is due. Any work you can begin to do now to compile your process book in advance will be helpful.
- You have your first of two exams, so start reviewing the key concepts from past weeks. These will be short answer questions that require you to recall and explain key concepts often along with examples.
- You will need to submit your Project 2 Part A: Proposal next week as well. So please look ahead at that and be prepared.

I hope you have a wonderful week.

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
