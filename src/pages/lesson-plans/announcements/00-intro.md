Dear students,

***[AAA---Brief personal greeting]***

I'm excited to dive into the course with you as we officially launch ***[BBB---tomorrow/today/etc]***.

Note the following:

* In this online course, CULearn and the Course Website linked therein are your key sources of information along with announcements like this one. Be sure to keep an eye out as these will be key to keeping up to date in the course.
* You can get in and look around the setup now. Begin Lesson 0 as soon as you can as it contains the syllabus and your first introductory activities.
* Our schedule in this course will be pretty stable with most "modules" or "lessons" spanning one week, from Saturday to the following Friday. You'll typically have reading over the weekends, initial discussion or exercise posts due by 5pm Tuesday, and other assignments due by 5pm Friday. Any changes not already noted on the schedule will be announced via announcements like this one.
* Please know that discussion and connection are crucial in this course. Please set aside regular times to complete the requirements. Despite being an online course, I care very much to hear from you if you have any additional questions or concerns. Feel free to reach out via email or find me online in Google Chat during my virtual office hours, ***[CCC---list virtual office hour dates/times such as "Thursdays from 7--9pm"]***

User Experience and interface design are fields that badly need the influence of compassionate, genuine people, and I believe God may be preparing some of you to enter it and make a difference for his kingdom. I'm looking forward to working through this course with you this term!

Best,
***[DDD---Prof name]***
