Dear Students,

Thanks for participating in the Introduction unit. ***[AAA---thoughts on intro week discussions such as "I've posted some general reflections in each forum where I read some fruitful discussions and nice introductions."]***

Moving on to Lesson 1 we dive into two main threads: user research using contextual research, and the practical "design of everyday things." These help us step outside of interactive design to consider more broadly what it is to design things for people, and how to meaningful place that work in the lives of the people for whom we're designing.

A few notes about discussions moving forward:

* Each week's discussions will be worth a total of 10 points. These points will be distributed between your various required posts, typically two points per post. Any variation will usually be explained in the initial discussion instructions at the top of the discussion page. You will typically be required to post replies to some threads I will have set up in advance. Simply find the numbered thread such as "1.1" and click "reply" for your initial response. If you are required to also reply to peers, find the post you want to respond to and click "Reply" to respond to it. I will look at your whole body of posts for the week in order to give you a score for that week.
* In terms of quality for your discussions, note that I am typically NOT looking for long posts. A well-written paragraph that addresses the prompt is usually sufficient unless instructed otherwise. The goal for me is to start discussion that you carry on, and not just to ask you for rote details. So if the question is broad, don't hesitate to narrow in on a specific aspect. Leave room for others to share more in their response, to add onto yours in a reply, or push further with some questions back to you. Therefore, your responses are just as important as your initial posts, and weighted just as heavily in most cases. Bottom line: no long essays, and no short "I agrees." Add something to the conversation each time you post.
* Lastly, whenever relevant (which should be most of the time!) please make sure to reference required readings in your posts. I'm not asking for scholarly citations but I do want to get a sense that you have actually read the required material each week.

Also a few notes on the project deliverables: If you haven't already looked ahead, please note that one of the final artifacts you will create for both projects in this course is a process book. Process books make excellent portfolio pieces as they show to prospective employers and clients not just the final product but the process you went through to get there. And since process is one of the key things we're studying in this course, this is all the more important.

Therefore, please consider each deliverable along the way as an item to be creating with that end goal in mind. Generally, you do not need to write large amounts of content but what you do write should be intentional, focused, and clear. I would rather have several well-written sentences or a concise bulleted list over long fluffy prose any day. And this kind of writing works well in process books too. So as you look at the required structure for this week's deliverable be sure to address each of the elements, but know you do not have to do so in an exhaustive way. Think about who might read your process book down the road and make your prose read well to impress that audience... and me :)

Looking forward to this next lesson and to your Project 1A: Proposals. Be sure to view the instructions and plan ahead this week!

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
