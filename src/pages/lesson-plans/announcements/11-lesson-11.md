Dear Students,

***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

Your final project is a big deal. I don't want to take away from that effort with too many deliverables due all at once. I also know this time of year is crazy. So in order to allow as much of our class time for you to focus on the project, I'm going to cancel the final exam and adjust the Biblical Perspectives paper.

With the exam removed, I'd like to instead make the final paper a combination of what it is now (key takeaways from a Biblical perspective on this field) and a summary of key points from the course topics. So rather than it being just a Biblical perspectives paper, I'd like to reframe it as your personal manifesto for Interactive Design. I've posted instructions in the course website where this item is listed as due and under the Activities link in the main navigation. The Exam category in our syllabus is worth 20% and the paper is worth 10%. I'm unable to update the syllabus at this time, but will make these changes as soon as I can and post the updated form.

Be sure you're planning ahead to complete the last two deliverables for this project with excellence: the design comps and prototype build in InVision are due this week and your process book is due the final week of the course.
As always please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
