Dear students,

If you do not already have a free account with InVision set up with educational benefits, you should [create one here](https://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup) using your Cedarville email address. Enter the following validation code for educational access: **56-73-13-19**

The main feature to know about this tool is the ability to add screens to the project that you can hyperlink together and then share with others for feedback. You can upload your screen images online or by using the Craft Plugin for Sketch.

- On your own Mac you can download and install the Craft plugin directly but you'll also need Sketch.
- In the Tyler labs the CraftManager application is installed. Open it from the the Applications folder and it should appear as an icon in the main Apple OS toolbar in upper right. Click this icon and choose to install the Sketch tools. (DO NOT try to install the Adobe CC tools as they cause problems and do not currently work; and you don't need them anyway since you're required to use Sketch!) Once the Sketch tools are installed you can click the command in the Craft manager to restart Sketch. You'll then see the Craft plugin toolbar down the right side of the Sketch interface.
- Use the Craft plugin tutorials provided in the support section for Sketch to learn how to connect and upload to InVision when ready.

So here's a review of the process:

1. Create a project in InVision in the browser and add the professor as a collaborator on the project using their CU email address.
2. Switch to Sketch on the desktop to finalize design deliverables such as mockups or style tiles.
3. Use the Craft Plugin for Sketch to connect to InVision and upload deliverables as "screens" to a project you set up in advance.
4. With screens uploaded return to InVision in the browser to add hotspots and review feedback.
