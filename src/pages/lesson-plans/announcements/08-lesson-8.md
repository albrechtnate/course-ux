Dear Students,

***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

This week we get to the skeleton and surface layers from Garret's text, which are likely familiar to you. But don't take them for granted; there are key differences in our mindset as we design for interactive designs that are different from working with traditional graphic design.

Be sure to review the requirements for P2C due this week and stay on top of the work required. Note there is a brief additional reading in the deliverable instructions here as well.

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
