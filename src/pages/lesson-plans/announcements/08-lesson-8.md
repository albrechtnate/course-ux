Dear Students,

***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

This week we get to the skeleton and surface layers from Garret's text, which are likely familiar to you. But don't take them for granted; there are key differences in our mindset as we design for interactive designs that are different from working with traditional graphic design. You also have P2B due this Tuesday from its extension from last week. I hope your research is well under way and showing some helpful insights already!

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
