## 5.1 UX and Business

Think broadly about "user experience" to consider what it means for even a traditional business such as a bakery or clothing store. How do some of the principles Garrett discusses in the first two chapters relate this broadly? How about from Holtzblatt's Design for Life?

## 5.2 User-centered Design

In user-centered design we shift the focus of design from ourselves as designers, or from the company itself, to the users. Think of a product or experience you had where you felt the company or designer really succeeded with this idea and designed or structured an experience or product that you felt was made just for you. What was this experience like?

## 5.3 Affordances and Signifiers in Garrett's Planes

Consider how Garrett's planes relate to our earlier discussion of affordances and signifiers. Where do these become apparent in this system?

## 5.4 Relating to Garrett's Planes

Choose one of Garrett's planes that you can relate to. While they'll all be explained in more detail, theorize here how this plane is impacted by the other planes.
