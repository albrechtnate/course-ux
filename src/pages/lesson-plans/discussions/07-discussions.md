Answer at least two of the following questions by 5pm Tuesday. Then answer at least three more questions or post in response to your peers or professor by 5pm Friday.

## 7.1 Understanding People in Interaction and Information Design

Garrett says that “interaction design and information architecture sound like esoteric, highly technical areas, but these disciplines aren't really about technology at all. They're about understanding people--the way they behave and think.” Choose either information architecture or interaction design and explain how this is true.

## 7.2 Evaluating Information or Interaction Design

Choose a tool you use each day and evaluate either its information architecture or its interaction design using terms and concepts discussed in this chapter.

## 7.3 Designer Pitfalls Addressed

Garrett describes how software developers can land in a pitfall when building software without thinking about interaction design. Can designers fall into a similar pitfall when thinking about the visual style and aesthetics of a site? How can either interaction design or information architecture address this pitfall?

## 7.4 Conceptual Models and Conventions

What is the relationship between a conceptual model and a convention according to Garrett? How does this discussion compare to your understanding of conceptual models from Don Norman?

## 7.5 Stretching Metaphors Like Butter Over Too Much Bread

Do you know examples of sites or tools like the Southwest Airline example in Chapter 5 where a conceptual model or metaphor was pushed too far?

## 7.6 Handling Errors Well

What is an example of a site or tool you’ve used that handled errors well? Likely you’ll have to think about it a bit since if they’re doing it well you’ve never noticed it! :) But when you’ve thought of such an example consider where you could have made an error and how the system anticipated that and prevented it or gently corrected you.

## 7.7 Ancient Information Architecture

Garrett claims that information architecture is a very old discipline. Describe a realistic but ancient scenario in which a person was doing this before there was a term for it. Use concepts from this chapter in your description.

## 7.8 cedarville.edu: top-down or bottom-up?

Do you think Cedarville University’s main outside-facing website uses a primarily top-down architecture or a bottom-up architecture? Or is it balanced between the two? Why do you conclude one or the other?

## 7.9 Describing Architecture

Describe a site you use frequently in terms of one of the architectural structures Garrett describes in Chapter 5. Also describe the organizational principle(s) you think is/are in play. Finally, do you think the facets they chose to base their organization on were the right ones? Why or why not?
