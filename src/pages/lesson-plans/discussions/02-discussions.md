For this lesson **everyone must complete items 2.1 and 2.2** in which we practice with observation techniques. These 2 posts will be a little larger than a typical post and count for 3 points each this week. See these two threads for the deadlines for each.

For the remainder **post at least 2 more times** by replying to your peers' posts or by answering any of the remaining numbered questions posed in the threads below or reply to **by 5pm Friday.**

### 2.1 Observations, Part 1

#### Observation Activity Overview

The purpose of this exercise is to give you experience with the observation method of contextual research. One of the most challenging things for us to overcome in order step outside of ourselves as designers is to slow down, turn away from our projects, and just observe. This two-part exercise aims to help you build the ability to watch with focus and patience. You will conduct two separate 30-minute sessions out of which you will record notes to discuss with the class in a future meeting.

**By Tuesday, 5pm complete the following:**

1. Identify a time and location that you can conduct your two separate sessions. Ideally, aim for a similar time of day and the same spot for your two sessions. You are not expected to control the environment in any way, but simply to sit back and observe what happens. For example, you could plan to sit outside a restaurant at lunch hour on Monday and Wednesday, or sit in a library foyer from 8–8:30pm on Monday and Wednesday. Just ensure that your first session happens before this first reply is due!
2. For your first session do not take any notes during the session. Simply watch the body language and actions of the people you encounter. If someone stops to talk to you, feel free to talk, but try not to let it interrupt your observation for long. As you watch make only mental notes and try to just let your curiosity lead your observations. Stay focused, look for details, but keep an open mind.
3. After your first session, think back on your session and write down some of the main things you remember. As you reflect identify two or three patterns, behaviors or emotions you’d like to focus on in your next session and call them out for future reference. Record these observations and notes as your post responding to this thread.
4. Optionally, look at each others' posts and make any comments, questions or feedback you think would help.

See Thread 2.2 for the second portion of this exercise in which you'll conduct your second session.

### 2.2 Observations, Part 2

**As a followup to Thread 2.1 complete the following by 5pm Friday:**

1. Conduct your second observation session. This time, call to mind the things you identified out of your first session. Watch specifically for those things and keep notes, tallies or other records. Bring some tools that will allow you to make quick short notes.
2. After this second session finalize your notes into some summary statements. You are not expected to notice anything groundbreaking, but hopefully, to notice some details you didn’t notice before.
3. Post bullet-point summaries of your observations in response to this thread. Add a short reflection on this exercise. What did you learn about the exercise of observing? What would like to continue to develop on your own?

Keep an eye for each others' posts and comment to share thoughts, ideas and reactions.

### 2.3 Conceptual Models

What are conceptual models according to Norman, et. al? Give an example in your own life that also demonstrates why these matter for designers.

### 2.4 Principles of Contextual Inquiry

Choose one of the principles of contextual inquiry covered in this lesson and summarize it. Watch for follow-up questions.
