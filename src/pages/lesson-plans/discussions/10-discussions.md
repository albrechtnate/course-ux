Answer at least two of the threads by 5pm Tuesday. Then post at least three more times by 5pm Friday, either responding to others' posts or answering new questions.

## 10.1 Human-computer Interaction?

Walter points out that interface design falls in the field of Human-computer interaction. Why did he say he was not fond of that label? What do you think of the issue?

## 10.2 Personality of Products

Walter gave some examples of products that make use of personality to appeal to their audiences. Can you think of some other examples, whether effective or ineffective?

## 10.3 Prior Experience with Personas

What is your understanding of a traditional persona and how is it used? If you have used them before think critically: were they useful to you? Why or why not? Does the context of personas in interactive design change things for you?

## 10.4 Personas of Applications

Walter describes a different kind of persona for having a greater emotional impact or connection with users beyond the traditional persona. What is this persona? What do you think of this approach?

## 10.5 Personality as Business Practice

Think critically beyond interactive design: to what extent should a brand be focused on the company versus focused on appealing to the audience? How does this relate to personality of the front-facing aspects of the company? What does this imply for hiring and training in an organization? How does "company culture" relate?

## 10.6 All things to all people

Thinking about the idea of personality and appeal to audiences, consider what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9, especially in verses 19--23. How could this relate to our gospel impact in the workplace, espcially in light of what we've learned about designing for emotion? How does this passage relate to or instruct us in light of our culture's emphasis on self expression and "being yourself?"

## 10.7 Emotional Engagement

Choose and describe one of the aspects of emotional engagement Walter discusses in Chapter 4. Critique an existing site or application in light of this idea.
