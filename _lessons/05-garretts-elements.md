### UX in Digital Design

Above all, this course is about effective design of interactive solutions. But how do we determine whether something is "effective?" Is it a matter of making profit? Is it about a complete and functional product or solution? Or is it about the experience our users have with the solution?

Perhaps it is all of these. Let's dive into our first set of content. We'll start with the Garrett text.

### Garrett's Elements of UX

Lets learn more about the five planes of user-centered design. As a designer, you'll probably tend to think first about the way something should look. But the planes Garrett explains provide a richer context for the visual (surface) aspect.

***Read Chapter 2 from [Garrett][garrett]***

Our project processes in this course will largely mirror the planes outlined here. First we'll set the goals of an application (strategy). Then we'll move on to do some research and determine the requirements (scope), then develop personas and task flow diagrams (structure) followed by wireframes, which we will test extensively (skeleton). Finally, we will skin those wireframes and string them together to create a prototype (surface).
