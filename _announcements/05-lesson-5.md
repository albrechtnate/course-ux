Dear Students,

***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

Our discussions now transition to Garrett's Elements of User Experience, an easy-to-read overview of the UX fundamentals and a bit of a process for the practice as well.

Our deliverable this week gets into two technologies I want to ensure you have the heads up about in case either or both is new to you: Sketch and InVision.

*Sketch* is an excellent design tool that has quickly gained momentum as the tool of choice for web designers. I expect you to use Sketch for design work in this course. Work completed in other tools will result in a grade deduction. I have posted resources for learning sketch under the Support link in the course website. There is also information in Moodle Announcements regarding activating licenses in the labs in Tyler. Please plan ahead. This week you have a simple wireframe and style tile assignment that is a good opportunity to get into Sketch if it is your first time using it.

*InVision* is an online prototyping tool that allows us to show off our designs and simulate interactivity. While you don't officially start with this until next week I wanted to introduce it now in case its new to any of you. With this tool we basically upload images and then add hot spots that allow us to simulate navigation between "pages." We even have a sweet plugin for Sketch called Craft that makes this easy to sync our "artboards" from Sketch as "screens" or pages in InVision to add interactivity.

Just a reminder regarding "high fidelity" wireframes required for this deliverable:

* We are looking for accurate simulations of content, general placement of affordances and minimal visual hierarchy. Basically just neater digital versions of the paper prototypes you created over the last weeks.
* As these are digital you should use artboards approximately 1200px wide and as tall as needed. Go wider if desired, or narrower if you're intending to target mobile devices. Responsiveness is not needed otherwise.
* **We ARE NOT expecting colors or custom fonts in the WIREFRAMES.** Plain-ness is expected unless color or fonts are essential to sell the concept in the works. Keep to grey boxes and sans-serif fonts otherwise.
* You will eventually be syncing these to InVision to create a functional prototype but this week you can just export PDFs to show you've completed this stage.

In regard to the other portion of the deliverable, the Style Tiles, if you're new to style tiles [here is an explanation from the original creator](http://styletil.es/). We have provided a Sketch template you should use for your 2 style tiles. Your purpose here is to brainstorm the style elements of a design. Not planning layout at all, just showing style options. You should also ensure there is variety between the two you submit to show you're considering options. I'll also encourage you to think broadly about colors. In interactive solutions we typically need brand colors (one or two) that you use most; a body color for type; and then several other colors for states such as "success" "caution", etc. I'll see if I can collect a few examples to send out.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns! I'll be holding open lab tonight from 8--10pm in TYL 107. However, next week's lab will be cancelled as I am away on a trip.

Wishing you all the best,
