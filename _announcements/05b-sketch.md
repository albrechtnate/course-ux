Dear Students,

Its time to start learning Sketch if you haven't already. I draw your attention to the Support link navbar in the course website and the subsequent link to the Support Site. Here you'll find resources for Sketch to which I'll add this additional nice tutorial: [https://youtu.be/qywB0JHQeC4](https://youtu.be/qywB0JHQeC4]

To use Sketch in the Tyler Mac labs, log on to a machine with your CU username and password. Then find the Sketch application from the Applications section. When you open it the first time on a given Mac you may be able to enter a "trial" mode but will eventually be prompted for the license/key. Enter this:

**SK3-2423-2054-6049-1500-9840** (use this ONLY in the Tyler Mac labs; unauthorized use may result in disciplinary action)

Here are a few other tips/reminders:

* I have videos in this course that both use and demonstrate key uses of Sketch.
* Please start learning this tool ASAP. If you delay this from this week you will have extra to make up in a few weeks when we begin to insert images into our pages.
* Sketch is available for you to use in all the VCD labs in TYL (103, 105, and 107) and you should be able to use your ID card to scan into those rooms anytime.
* Due to classes in those rooms the best times will likely be after 3pm on weekdays. They also usually do not have any classes scheduled in them on Wednesdays.
* If you want to use Sketch elsewhere you will need a Mac and must purchase a license for Sketch. In my opinion this is a worthwhile investment as this tool is excellent. You can get an educational discount on a one-time license that you don't have to pay a monthly subscription to use like you do with Adobe CC. It is all around a very affordable option. https://www.sketchapp.com/ In a pinch there is a free trial you can use. However, I recommend that you save any potential need for this until later in the course when our use of the tool will be much heavier.
