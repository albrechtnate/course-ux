Dear Students,

Thanks for participating in the Introduction unit. ***[AAA---thoughts on intro week discussions such as "I've posted some general reflections in each forum where I read some fruitful discussions and nice introductions."]***

Moving on to Lesson 1 we dive into two main threads: user research using contextual research, and the practical "design of everyday things." These help us step outside of interactive design to consider more broadly what it is to design things for people, and how to meaningful place that work in the lives of the people for whom we're designing.

A few notes about discussions moving forward:

* Each week's discussions will be worth a total of 10 points. These points will be distributed between your various required posts, typically two points per post. Any variation will usually be explained in the forum post as a whole. So each week make sure you click on the Forum from the main page of Moodle and read the description on the very next page before diving into any of the provided threads. Your score will be awarded per post, so don't be alarmed if you see a post rated as 2/10... that means 2 of your overall 10 points, not that that individual post was poor. The points should add up to 10 for each successful forum.
* In terms of quality for your discussions, note that I am typically NOT looking for long posts. A well-written paragraph that addresses the prompt is usually sufficient unless instructed otherwise. It is hard to write good discussion prompts, and something I'm trying to get better at. The goal for me is to start discussion not ask for rote details. So if the question is broad, don't hesitate to narrow in on a specific aspect. Leave room for others to share more in their response, to add onto yours in a reply, or push further with some questions back to you. Therefore, your responses are just as important to me as your initial posts, and weighted just as heavily in most cases. Bottom line: no long essays, and no short "I agrees." Add something to the conversation each time you post.
* Lastly, whenever relevant (which should be most of the time!) please make sure to reference required readings in your posts. I'm not asking for scholarly citations but I do want to get a sense that you have actually read the required material each week.

Looking forward to this next lesson and to your Project 1 Proposals. Be sure to view the instructions and plan ahead this week!

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
