Dear Students,

***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

We will begin to settle into a regular rhythm from here forward with predictable discussion assignment and project deliverable due dates.

Regarding your testing sessions I have a few additional tips to help your tests go smoothly:

* First be sure to review the sample report I've linked in the P1D instructions and especially the protocol section. You will benefit greatly by going into the test session with a clear game plan or agenda, and some up front disclaimers to the users about the purpose of the test and to put them at ease. Again, you should also be targeting specific tasks that users can accomplish in the app even if they're simple such as finding some information if that's something users will likely do in the final solution. It is important to help your users feel at ease and to clarify that you're testing the prototype, not the user. Also feel free to go 'off script' from the protocol when needed to. You can then return to it when a thread has been sufficiently tied up. You also should not expect users to do exactly as you expect in the protocol. Be prepared to interact with them graciously when they do things you don't expect. Finally, be careful to word things so don't just lead them along your thought pattern. This could bias the test if you're not careful.
* As you conduct the sessions favor keeping what is in front of the user at any time *simple and neat*; prefer removing past screens instead of continuing to lay new ones on top of old ones. It should always be obvious and clear to the user what is really an option for them in any given screen.
* It is very easy to get caught up and not actual observe your users during the test. Consider having an assistant helping you with things to help you focus on observation and interaction with your user. Watch for pauses. Encourage them to think out loud. If they do things you don't expect, be gracious and curious.

I'm looking forward to hearing how things go. Plan ahead and do as many session as you can!

Next, as we move forward please remember that threaded discussion is meant to be truly discussion; try to avoid answering prompts in such a way that you leave little room for others to answer. I have tried to write prompts that invite you to address part of a concept, examples, or opinions. But don't ever worry that you'll be dinged in the score for not addressing all possible aspects of something the prompt is requesting. Favor choosing something specific to address and keep posts at a robust paragraph or so (three to four sentences with real substance are usually sufficient unless you're telling a story or describing something that just requires a little more). Bottom line: be brief but thoughtful and substantive like what you might say in a class discussion and leave room for others to pick up and continue the conversation. You could even ask a follow up question... :)

Have a great week,
