Dear Students,

***[AAA---Short debrief or grading status]***

Now for Lesson 6 we will dive into the details for the Scope and Strategy planes from the Garret text. Your project deliverable this week is to build out your full mockups and wire them up on InVision as an interactive prototype. Note that you DO NOT have to build or link every page, but you must at least simulate the task or tasks you tested and targeted to improve in the project goals. As a reminder, you must use Sketch to complete this deliverable as well as implement the Craft plugin to upload to InVision. Please plan to test this early in the week so you're not caught last minute later if something doesn't work as expected.

I hope you have a wonderful week.

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
