Post at least two times in either or both of the threads 3.1 and 3.2 **by 5pm Tuesday.** Each post is worth 2 points.

Also look ahead at 3.3 and plan ahead to be sure you are pacing yourself to complete the sketching assignment described therein. **Post in that thread by 5pm Friday.** This post will count for 6 points.

### 3.1 Interpretation Sessions

Debrief on Holtzblatt's description of the interpretation. Choose any one of these prompts to answer for your post on this thread: What is the interpretation session? Choose one of the roles involved and describe it. Why do think we do the interpretation session this way?

### 3.2 Gulfs of Evaluation and Execution

Choose either the gulf of execution or the gulf of evaluation. Describe it and give an example of such a situation in practical terms.

### 3.3 Sketching Exercise

Having completed our introduction to the Design of Everyday things, let's round this out by getting into rapid sketching with a thorough sketching exercise.

#### Overview

This exercise challenges you to study some products that you and other people around you use commonly. Toothbrushes, backpacks, doorknobs and handles, and other similar non-digital devices are examples of things you could study.

You will study several examples of such objects and analyze both the common affordances and signifiers as well as note distinguishing features. You will make rapid sketches of the objects that will both exercise your sketching abilities and challenge you to think through the shape and form of the products.

#### Process

##### Phase 1: Studying

1. Choose 3 common objects or products to study that are not digital and exhibit a good balance between being complex in shape and form but not overly complex. For example, a digital SLR camera is too complex; a cell phone is too simple. A toothbrush, though simple, often contains nuances of form that are work exploring and acceptable for this study; an ornate vase may be common but is not used often enough to merit study in this exercise.
2. Spend time exploring the products by holding them, turning them around, and considering each of the shapes, forms, and features of the object.
3. Look for at least 3 other examples or instances of the same product that are designed differently. Repeat the same observation process with the other instances. So if you had chosen to study your favorite coffee mug, you should identify and study 3 other examples of coffee mugs that are different from yours in some way. "Mug" would be the object, and your own mug is one "instance" of "mug"; the other 3 "mugs" you study are 3 additional "instances" of "mug."

##### Phase 2: Loose sketching

Narrow down to 2 of the objects and 3 of the instances of it that are most interesting, and move forward to create small, rapid, loose sketches. Create 3 sketches of each instance of each object. So:

*2 objects × 3 instances of each object × 3 rapid sketches of each instance = 18 individual sketches.*

Use as many sheets of paper as you need for this phase but feel free to work at small sizes: one object per page (three instances x three sketches = 9 sketches on the page) is completely acceptable. We're not striving for artwork; no shading or coloring is needed. Scan these pages or take neat photos of the pages.

##### Phase 3: Refined and labeled sketches

Now being familiar with the objects narrow down to one instance of each object for a detailed study.

1. Create a more polished sketch for one representative instance of each object. By polished, I mean clean and readable, but don’t feel like you have to add shading or be intricately precise unless this would help communicate features of the object. Ideally, fit this on one page for each object: 2 total pages.
2. Neatly label roughly 3 key affordances and/or signifiers that were generally common between all instances of the object.
3. In space around this primary sketch add at least 2 small detail sketches to call out difference between the object you sketched here and other instances of the object. Label these with brief descriptions of the differences.

#### Submission

Having completed this exercise, submit the following in a single combined PDF file to attach here in a single post:

* Scans of your 18 loose sketches (3 sketches of each of 3 instances of each of 2 objects)
* Scans of your 2 pages of refined and labeled sketches (1 object featured per page that include 1 primary sketch labeling at least 3 features; at least 2 additional detail sketches)
