## Weekly Guides

### 0. Introduction

Above all, keep in mind that this course is about User Experience... and as we try to influence students on this topic modeling it ourselves is key. Be gracious, honest, and considerate even when holding them to a high bar for quality work.

Action items this week include:

* Send out Welcome announcement on first day of class
* Keep an eye on discussion forums and interact with students as they post.

### 1. Lesson 1

Action items:

* Send announcement at start of week to remind of upcoming stuffs.
* Review participation from the previous week and complete the Roster Verification the Office of Registrar likely sent out. Any students who either didn't complete the required intro activities may be marked as "absent".
* Engage in discussions.
* Project deliverable 1A: Look to ensure students are considering more than just visual aspects but truuly task-oriented, navigational, or labeling issues with their proposed site. Steer any misplaced plans toward these or encourage students to choose different topics.

### 2. Lesson 2

Action items:

* This week involves a different kind of activity in the discussions, the Observation Exercise. Be sure to be familiar with it.
* Send announcement at start of week to remind of upcoming stuffs, particularly the different activity mentioned above.
* Engage in discussions.
* Project deliverable 1B: As before, look to ensure students are focusing on specific tasks for their users to accomplish (and consider whether the tasks are practical, likely tasks for the actual audience).

### 3. Lesson 3

Action items:

* This week involves another different kind of exercise in the discussions, the Sketching Exercise. Emphasis should be placed on *rapid prototyping* not artistic renderings. While we're looking for depictions that successfully communicate, we're also looking for critical thought about the objects themselves to see students digesting the topics to date.
* Send announcement at start of week to remind of upcoming activities, particularly the different one mentioned above.
* Engage in discussions.
* Project Deliverable 1C: Wireframes should be **LOW FIDELITY** but true wireframes with a) enough content to determine what is intended, particularly towards accomplishing a task and b) loose enough without too much stress on visual style.

### 4. Lesson 4

* Discussions settle into a regular rhythm this week and moving forward.
* Engage in discussions.
* Project Deliverable 1D: Looking now for them to have tested their wireframe and task-oriented use cases with actual users. Successful submissions follow the provided structure, especially having a protocol for their test sessions that is intentional and appears to have *actually been used* during test. In report, look for critical thought, diligent work, and stress on the task at hand. Willingness to adjust based on feedback rather than just checking the box and calling it "done". **In Preparation, draw attention to the sample report that includes a sample protocol.**

### 5. Lesson 5

* Start to use InVision in coming weeks, so make a separate announcement with the semester's InVision Access code. Also the first week to officially use Sketch for deliverables, so pointing students to resources on Course Website is good if they need to learn Sketch.
* Engage in discussions.
* Project Deliverable 1E: Now we can move into using digital tools such as Sketch so we should see more refinement to wireframes but still not any real visual style. Be sure to call this out to help students who tend to want to more on to full style to still stay focused on the skeleton layer of the project.

### 6. Lesson 6

* Give students head's up about process book portion that is due with the final submission of the project; they would be wise to start compiling this now if they haven't already.
* Engage in discussions.
* Project Deliverable 1F: First Sketch deliverable that we sync to InVision. Looking now to give detailed feedback on visual style, but keeping in mind the tasks users are aiming to accomplish and how the visual style assists/improves versus detracts. More feedback now saves time on the final submission and gives students a chance to earn best grade possible.

### Exam week

Take exam and submit final for P1 including the process book.

### 7. Lesson 7

* Engage in discussions.
* Project Deliverable 2B: Give students head's up about user research and methods. They will greatly benefit from going into any sessions with a protocol or questionnaire rather than trying to "wing it"---and such a tool is required in the appendix for this submission.

### 8. Lesson 8

* Engage in discussions.
* Project Deliverable 2C: Stress task-focused design in this deliverable. Students should be demonstrating a strong sense of key tasks users will complete in their application, even if they don't plan to prototype all of those tasks. Evaluate whether the task they've chosen to work with make sense, and seem indeed to be key features of the application.

### 9. Lesson 9

* Engage in discussions.
* Project Deliverable 2D: This is similar to the previous deliverable from P1 so they should have some experience with this. Again continue to evaluate the task they're designing and the strength with which they are executing on it.

### 10. Lesson 10

* Engage in discussions.
* Similar deliverables as before; its all in the execution now.

### 11. Lesson 11

* Engage in discussions.
* Similar deliverables as before; its all in the execution now.

### 12. Lesson 12

* Engage in discussions.
* Similar deliverables as before; its all in the execution now.
